# FCFS Scheduling Simulation

A **React-based simulation** of the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) CPU Scheduling Algorithm.  
This project provides a **visual and interactive** way to understand FCFS through **tables and Gantt charts**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **React** – Frontend library for UI components  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for styling  
- **Chart.js / React-chartjs-2** – For Gantt chart and data visualization  

---

## ✨ Features
- Dynamic input for number of processes, burst times, and (optional) arrival times  
- Automatic calculation of:
  - **Waiting Time (WT)**  
  - **Turnaround Time (TAT)**  
  - **Average WT & TAT**  
- Results displayed in **tabular format**  
- Interactive **Gantt Chart** to visualize process scheduling  
- Clean and responsive UI

## 📖 The Process
1. **User Input**  
   - Enter number of processes and their burst times (and arrival times if required).  

2. **Computation**  
   - Apply **FCFS Algorithm**: processes scheduled in the order they arrive.  
   - Waiting and Turnaround times are computed for each process.  

3. **Output**  
   - A **results table** with WT & TAT for each process.  
   - **Average WT & TAT** displayed.  
   - A **Gantt Chart** that visually represents execution order.
